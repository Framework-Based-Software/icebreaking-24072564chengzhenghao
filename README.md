# Introduction
Hi! I'm [CHENG ZHENGHAO], a student in the Framework-Based Software Design and Development course. 
In this course, I expect to learn the following:

1. Framework Basics: Understand the concepts, functions and common design patterns of software frameworks (such as MVC, three-tier architecture).
2. Mainstream Frameworks: Learn common development frameworks such as Spring, Django, Node.js, etc.
3. Framework Configuration and Integration: How to configure the framework, manage dependencies, and integrate with components such as databases, caches, and message queues.
4. Modular Development: How to split business logic to improve the maintainability and scalability of code.
5. API Design and Implementation: Use the framework to develop RESTful API or GraphQL API, and master the authentication and authorization mechanism.
6. Testing and Debugging: How to write unit tests, integration tests, and debug problems in framework applications.
7. Performance Optimization: Understand the underlying mechanism of the framework, and learn how to optimize the code to improve the performance of the application.
8. Project Practice: Practice the application of the framework through actual projects, from demand analysis to development, deployment and maintenance.
